# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze sentiment patterns within the **Sentiment140** dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets annotated with sentiment polarity. The goal is to understand the sentiment trends in these tweets and develop a robust sentiment analysis model using advanced NLP, machine learning, and neural network techniques.

## 📊 Summary

### Dataset:
- **Sentiment140 Dataset**: 1.6 million tweets labeled with sentiment polarity (0 for negative, 2 for neutral, 4 for positive).

### Goal:
To build a sentiment analysis model that accurately predicts the sentiment of tweets, using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

### 📈 Key Analyses:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The tweets are cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and prepare the text for modeling.
- **Modeling**: Several models are tested, including machine learning models and neural networks for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and performance evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For implementing neural network models.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For data visualization.

## 📌 Conclusions:
This project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis. While initial models provide decent accuracy, the neural network models further improve performance.

⚠️ **Note**: The dataset is not included due to its size. Instructions for downloading the dataset are provided within the notebooks.
