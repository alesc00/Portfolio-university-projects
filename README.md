## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Alessandro Scarpato, a Data Scientist with a passion for AI-driven solutions, machine learning, and software engineering.  
🎓 I will graduate in mid-December 2024 with a Master's Degree in Data Science from Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore.  
💼 Currently, I am completing an internship at Toyota Motor Europe in Brussels, where I am working as an AI engineer.  
My work focuses on integrating advanced AI technologies to enhance user interaction and data retrieval.

⚠️ These projects reflect the work of a student eager to explore various fields in data science and machine learning. While they may appear somewhat rudimentary, they represent a foundation built with a strong enthusiasm for learning and growing in the field. Each project demonstrates key concepts, with the understanding that there is always room for refinement and improvement as I continue to expand my knowledge and experience.

🌱 *I’m always learning, always growing!*
